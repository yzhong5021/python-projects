HW_regression.ipynb
	Generates data from a linear function, then performs OLS regression on it. Evaluates polynomials and their derivative in order to perform a 1-D gradient descent. Performs an N-D gradient descent on a linear function.

Gauss_Data_Analysis.ipynb
	Estimates MLE mean μ and variance σ^2 of a sample pickle dataset.

SEER_breast_cancer-synthetic.ipynb
	Imports breast cancer data from SEER and generates violin plots, histograms, and contingency tables for visualization.
	
SEER_distribution_hypothesis_v2.ipynb
	Fit SEER breast cancer data to normal, triangle, and beta distributions. Tests different hypotheses using a Student's t-test, F-test, and two-sided KS test. 

K-S_tests.ipynb
	1-sample and 2-sample KS tests on generated data.

HW_inference_metrics.ipynb
	This file contains methods to calculate the R^2 of a regression model, the confusion matrix given an array of truth labels and estimated labels, and classification metrics such as f1 score and specificity. We generate ROC and P-R curves using sample data.
